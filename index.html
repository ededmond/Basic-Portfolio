            <p>Welcome to my homepage! The picture (hopefully to the left) was actually taken in Thailand!
                My sister taught English there for a year, and my parents and I went to visit her. It's really amazing 
                what parents will pay just so they can see both their kids on Christmas!

                Now, this text is supposed to both take up space, and tell people about me my personality, so I figured 
                I'd let you in on a little of my thought processes while writing the previous paragraph (show don't tell,
                after all-- what if you didn't believe me!). Well, as a kid I always had trouble distinguishing between what was
                implied and what was told in English class. So, here's my question: in the above statement, I never explicitly stated
                that I had only one sibling; a sister, but it's the only logical explanation given that I said my parents wanted 
                to see 'both' their kids. Does that count as only implying that? Surprisingly, even at 23, I'm not quite sure of the answer!
            </p>
            <p>Fun fact about me: Because I have two middle names, both starting with 'M,'
             my initials <i>almost</i> spell my first name!
